NBA All-Star Prediction Using Machine Learning
The goal of our project is to use NBA player data to create a machine learning algorithm that will predict the likelihood of a player being an all-star. We will be looking at various player statistics from each regular season from 2011/12 through 2021/22 to predict the likelihood of a player becoming an all-star. Success will be measured by testing created models with earlier stats from players who became all-stars and seeing how accurate the predictions are.
